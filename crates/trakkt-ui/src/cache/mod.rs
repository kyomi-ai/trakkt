//! Client-side persistent cache and reactive in-memory store for the sync
//! engine.
//!
//! ### `store` — reactive in-memory store (all targets)
//!
//! [`store::SyncStore`] is the single source of truth for list pages. It is
//! available on both SSR and WASM targets so page components that read from it
//! compile on both. On SSR the store is empty; pages show a loading state until
//! `initialized()` becomes `true` on the client after IDB hydration.
//!
//! ### `db` — IndexedDB persistence (WASM only)
//!
//! On WASM targets the persistent cache is backed by two IndexedDB object
//! stores (via `indexed_db_futures`) that survive page reloads without
//! round-tripping to the server on startup.  See [`db`] for the full schema
//! and API.
